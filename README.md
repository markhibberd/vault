## Vault

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markhibberd/vault.png)](https://travis-ci.org/markhibberd/vault)

#### What is Vault?

Vault is a scala library for interacting with persistence storage
through the JDBC database API (or potentially other).

Vault is licenced under BSD3 (see `LICENCE`).

### Documentation

Non existent. But will happen soon. For now here is an example which may or may not
help <https://github.com/markhibberd/vault/blob/master/src/test/scala/vault/Example.scala>.

### SBT Settings

Experimental:

    "io.mth" %% "vault" % "0.5"

### Provenance

Vault was initially developed to support products at [Ephox](http://ephox.com).

The library was open-sourced under a [BSD License](https://github.com/markhibberd/vault/blob/master/LICENSE), drawing users, support and improvements from a number of contributors.

The initial developers have since left the employment of Ephox and now maintain this fork `markhibberd/vault`.

It is expected that major releases will now come from this repository.
